My very own Kerbal Space Program module, it's mainly for interplanetary launch window calculation. 
The most important piece is the class "orbit", which holds data and has methods to calculate positions on Keplerian orbits. 
There are functions to calculate Hohmann transfer orbits with dv requirements, find SOI (Sphere of Influence) changes, optimize launch windows, draw and print data. As of now, inclined orbits are calculated, but plane change maneuvers are not implemented.
This is a work in progress, I'm doing it for fun, at my own pace.
