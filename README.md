My very own Kerbal Space Program module, it's mainly for interplanetary launch window calculation. 
The most important piece is the class "orbit", which holds data and has methods to calculate positions on Keplerian orbits. 
There are functions to calculate Hohmann transfer orbits with dv requirements, optimize launch windows, draw and print data. As of now, inclined orbits are calculated, but plane change maneuvers are not implemented.
